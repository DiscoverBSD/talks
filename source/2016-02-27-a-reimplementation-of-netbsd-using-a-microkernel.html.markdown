###Abstract for talk:

In this session we will talk about how to install FreeBSD to MicroModularServer and how to manage and control those servers. To install FreeBSD to High Density Servers including NEC MicroModularServer or HP Moonshot, you need another skill compared to install to common PCs and rack mount servers. This kind of servers (low energy consumption, low computing power and high space efficient) are good for too many edge servers/web servers at limited rack space, for example, as an alternative system for Blade servers or many cores servers like Sun Fire T1000/T2000.
